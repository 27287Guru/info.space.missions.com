                        Launched on October 4, 1957, Sputnik 1 was the world's first artificial 
                        satellite and marked the beginning of the space age. It orbited Earth for 
                        three weeks, transmitting radio signals that were received around the world.

                        Gagarin an international hero and demonstrated Soviet space supremacy during 
                        the early years of the Space Race.

                        The Luna program consisted of a series of robotic spacecraft missions 
                        launched between 1959 and 1976. Luna 2, launched in 1959, was the first 
                        spacecraft to reach the Moon, impacting its surface. Luna 9, launched in 1966, 
                        was the first spacecraft to achieve a soft landing on the Moon and transmit images 
                        from the lunar surface.

                        Salyut program: Launched between 1971 and 1986, the Salyut space stations 
                        were the world's first space stations. They served as platforms for scientific 
                        research and international collaboration in space.
                        Mir: Launched in 1986 and operated until 2001, Mir was a modular space station 
                        that served as a microgravity research laboratory and hosted long-duration human space 
                        missions. It was a precursor to the International Space Station (ISS).

                        ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO): Launched in 2016 in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA), 
                        TGO is studying the Martian atmosphere to understand its composition, particularly focusing on methane and 
                        other trace gases that could indicate biological or geological activity.
                        ExoMars Rover (Roscosmos is a partner): Planned to launch in 2022 (as of my last update), the ExoMars Rover 
                        will search for signs of past or present life on Mars, drill below the surface to collect samples, and analyze 
                        them for organic compounds.
